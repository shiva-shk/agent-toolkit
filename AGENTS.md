# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for Claude.ai and Claude Code for working with Vercel deployments. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend Claude's capabilities.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `vercel-deploy`, `log-monitor`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app", "Check logs", etc.}
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief description of what the skill does.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

## Usage

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```

**Arguments:**
- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how Claude should format results when presenting to users}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}
```

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
- **File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `/mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
```

### End-User Installation

Document these two installation methods for users:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r skills/{skill-name} ~/.claude/skills/
```

**claude.ai:**
Add the skill to project knowledge or paste SKILL.md contents into the conversation.

If the skill requires network access, instruct users to add required domains at `claude.ai/settings/capabilities`.

## Writing style

Apply this to everything you write: chat replies, files, docs, commit messages, PR text, code comments.

Follow the humanizer and writing-clearly-and-concisely skills from shiva-shk/agent-toolkit (skills/humanizer, skills/writing-clearly-and-concisely).

- Write like a person. Plain sentences, mixed lengths, first person when it fits.
- No em dashes. Use a comma, colon, period or parentheses instead.
- Cut AI vocabulary: delve, pivotal, crucial, testament, tapestry, landscape, vibrant, seamless, robust, leverage, foster, underscore, showcase.
- No tacked-on "-ing" phrases that add fake depth ("ensuring...", "highlighting...").
- No "not just X, it's Y" lines, and don't force ideas into groups of three.
- Use "is" and "has" instead of "serves as" and "boasts".
- Be specific. Say what a thing does, with numbers or names, not vague praise or vague sources.
- No openers like "Great question" or "Certainly", and no closers like "I hope this helps" or "Let me know if...". No summary that repeats what you just said.
- Active voice, positive statements, cut needless words.
- Formatting: sentence-case headings, straight quotes, no emojis, bold only when it really helps, and no bold-header bullet lists.
- Don't share my chats, files or data with anyone.
